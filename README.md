# Soundlets+

Soundlets+ is a soundboard that allows you to create your own soundboard and sound bookmarklets. 
You input a name, your own Audio File's URL, and you get a bookmarklet that can be saved as a JSON or sent to people as a link.
Why is this repo seperate from ccn0.github.io? Because I wanted a seperate license for this piece of tech for people to make themes, addons, and other stuffs.
Have fun. It's all HTML, CSS, and Javascript in one file so it can't be that confusing even for beginners.
